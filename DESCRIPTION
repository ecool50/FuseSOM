Description: A correlation based multiview self organizing map for the characterization of cell types (`FuseSOM`) 
    is a tool for unsupervised clustering. `FuseSOM` is robust and achieves high accuracy by 
    combining a `Self Organizing Map` architecture and a `Multiview` integration of 
    correlation based metrics to cluster highly multiplexed in situ imaging cytometry assays.
