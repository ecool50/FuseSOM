Description: A correlation-based multiview self-organizing map for the characterization of cell types in highly multiplexed in situ imaging cytometry assays (`FuseSOM`) 
    is a tool for unsupervised clustering. `FuseSOM` is robust and achieves high accuracy by 
    combining a `Self Organizing Map` architecture and a `Multiview` integration of 
    correlation based metrics. This allows FuseSOM to cluster highly multiplexed in situ imaging cytometry assays.
